					<h2>The Origin Story</h2>
					<p>Vaporwave is an artistic genre encompassing electronic music, visual art, and meme culture. It
						emerged in the early 2010s and is defined by its juxtaposition of internet culture and 1980s
						music. Vaporwave music often samples, chopps, and screws smooth jazz, elevator muzak, and lounge
						to create surreal, nostalgic soundscapes. The genre's subculture is often associated with a
						satirical take on consumer capitalism and pop culture as it tents to be characterized with
						nostalgic engagement with advertising of the previous decades (see <a

							CLVTVRE's Taste Of Paradise</a> which is a literal Bounty ad).</p>

					<h2>Modern Outlook</h2>
					<p>Modern vaporwave, and especially vaporwave music, has been taking on an interesting direction
						recently. Since vaporwave is so self-refferentail and base on pop culture, it is now starting to
						reference itself. Newer vaporwave tracks sample older ones instead of music from previous eras
						and parody albums like <a href="https://blankgoofee.bandcamp.com/releases">Blank Goofe</a> have
						become a mainstay of the genre. The musical characteristics are also changing. Vaporwave is
						going from back to simpler tracks with less screwed and chopped samples and more self-made
						sounds which are only inspired, instead of directly taken, from 80s music.</p><br>
